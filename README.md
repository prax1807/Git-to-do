# Git-to-do
All AI particualr projects done while job hunting :)
I am still workiing on them one by one while realising how to work with Git might also change dataset according to my prefrence too

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Implement a simple linear regression model to predict house energy consumption based on their size.
   - Using energy consumption dataset .
   - Calculate the best-fit line to energy vs size graph.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Build a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
   - Use the SpamAssassin Public Corpus dataset.I have used the easy spam and ham set
   - Example: Predict whether an email is spam based on its text features.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Implement a KNN algorithm to classify handwritten digits.
   - Use the MNIST dataset. I used the Keras Dataset 
   - Example: Classify digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel values.

4. **Decision Trees**:
   - Create a decision tree classifier to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year.
   - Use the Census Income dataset.
   - Example: Build a tree to classify income levels based on various features like age, education, and occupation.

5. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar customers based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Use a customer segmentation dataset.
   - Example: Segment customers into different groups based on their purchase history.

6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.
   - Apply it to the Iris dataset to visualize the data in 2D.
   - Example: Visualize high-dimensional data in a lower dimension while retaining as much information as possible.

7. **Naive Bayes Classifier**:
   - Build a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text documents.
   - Use the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
   - Example: Classify news articles into different categories based on their content.

8. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - Implement an SVM to classify images of cats and dogs.
   - Use the Cats vs. Dogs dataset.
   - Example: Classify images as either containing a cat or a dog.

9. **Neural Networks**:
   - Create a simple feedforward neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
   - Use the MNIST dataset.
   - Example: Train a neural network to classify digits from 0 to 9.

10. **Random Forest**:
    - Implement a random forest classifier to predict customer churn.
    - Use a customer churn dataset.
    - Example: Predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns and demographics.

11. **LLM**:
    - Use Ollamas linrary to get an llm working.
    - Clean prompts as per need.
    - Example: Extract python code from a given prompt.
